# My 3D-Portfolio

This project is a portfolio website built with React and Three.js.
## 3D Model Integration

- **Source**: A 3D model of a fox, sourced from platforms like Sketchfab .
- **Format**: The model is in glTF or GLB format for optimized transmission and rendering.
- **Conversion**: If needed, the glTF/GLB file is converted to JSX format using tools like [gltf.pmnd.rs](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/).

## React Three Fiber and Components

- **Setup**: Initialized with `create-react-app`, and React Three Fiber is installed to integrate Three.js with React.
- **Components**: Each section of the website (Home, About, Projects, Contact) is a React component.
- **Routing**: React Router DOM is used for client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between different sections without reloading the page.


## Contact Section

- **Form**: Includes fields for name, email, and message.
- **Functionality**: EmailJS is used to send the message upon form submission.
- **Interaction**: A 3D fox animation is added to enhance user engagement, reacting to user inputs.

## 3D Animation and Interaction

- **Mouse Control**: Users can navigate the 3D scene, which allows intuitive exploration of the scene.
- **Keyboard Control**: Users can interact with the 3D model using keyboard controls to move.
- **Animation**: Animations are used for the fox, with different animations triggered by user actions.
- **Sound**: We can play/stop the sound on Home Page by clicking on sound icon.

## Conclusion

This project leverages React, React Three Fiber, and Three.js to create an immersive and interactive portfolio website. The integration of 3D elements enhances user experience and showcases the modern technology
